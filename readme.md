Features added:

triggerbot + magnet
abilities triggerbot + magnet
shitty flick bot
a much faster screengrab
slightly better(?) smooth

I have made changes to the dll so to use this you' ll have to recompile it from the source uploaded here plus having 
the InputInterceptor (https://github.com/0x2E757/InputInterceptor) and interception dlls (https://github.com/0x2E757/InputInterceptor YOU ALSO NEED TO INSTALL THIS)
in the same folder as the ClassLibrary1.dll (the one you have to compile)

Once thats done edit grabber.py line 14 to the location of your dll
All the settings are in main.py I dont really use anything else other then the aim key so 
the settings arent tuned well, try messing around with the sleeps and stuff till you find a good balance.

I dont really code/ know what I am doing and the code is incredibly lazy but still this works fairly well imo.
