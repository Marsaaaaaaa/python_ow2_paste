features added:

trigger bot settings
flick settings (broken rn, fix is easy ill do it later)
kill switch
much faster screengrab

follow the instructions of the original uc post and then replace grabber.py and main.py
You ll then have to change some settings in BOTH files, they are pretty hard to miss.
most important is including your dll location

I made this at 2 am dont expect much
