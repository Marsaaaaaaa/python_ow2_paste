Features added:

* triggerbot + magnet.

* abilities triggerbot + magnet. (previous releases)

* a much faster screengrab.

* better smoothing.


Instructions:

I have made changes to the dll so to use this you' ll have to recompile it from the source uploaded here plus having: 

* InputInterceptor.dll (https://github.com/0x2E757/InputInterceptor) 

* interception.dll (https://github.com/oblitum/Interception YOU ALSO NEED TO INSTALL THIS)

* ClassLibrary1.dll

All in the same folder. 






Once thats done edit grabber.py line 14 to the location of the ClassLibrary dll.

All the settings are in main.py but I dont really use anything else other then the aim key so 

the settings arent tuned well, try messing around with the sleeps and stuff till you find a good balance.


In case you dont know how to run a python script: https://pythonbasics.org/execute-python-scripts/

If you dont know how to install python packages (import not recognized error or something like that): https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html
(the clr package is called pythonnet)




I dont really code/ know what I am doing and the code is incredibly lazy but still this works fairly well imo.
